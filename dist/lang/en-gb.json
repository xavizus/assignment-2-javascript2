    "profile": "My goal has always been to develop and learn as much as possible to make it easier for both users and administrators of IT systems. I am interested in both hardware and software, in the form of personal computers, servers and various types of programming.\nMy ultimate dream would be to start own or join a company and where the vision is to develop systems from the user's needs, instead of which it is usually to develop systems what one thinks the user's needs are. Where the company has the customer's focus and has the customer as a guiding star.\nMy keen interest in software and programming means that I constantly spend my free time on self-study in different areas, mainly the security and optimization that I have vast interested in.\nBecause I have experience from helpdesk and have had close contact with users, I know what users need and how they perceive systems that exist today.",

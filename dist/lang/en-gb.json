Where the company has the customer's focus and has the customer as a guiding star.</p><p>My keen interest in software and programming means that I constantly spend my free time on self-study in different areas, mainly the security and optimization that I have vast interested in.</p><p>Because I have experience from helpdesk and have had close contact with users, I know what users need and how they perceive systems that exist today.</p>"
